# Gem Graph 
This is just a fun project to search for the most influential gem in the 
Ruby-verse. My approach is to analyze the gem-index and find the gems that
are listed as dependencies in the largest amount of gems. 

The code to build the grouping (for the generated graph) is all in Ruby and
the code to generate the graph is in D3 (JS visualization library)
