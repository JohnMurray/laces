# Gem Graph 

This project represents the ongoing work for a research project that I am
working on to find the most influential Gem in the Ruby-verse. Right now
there are several directions that the research could take and many avenues
that could be explored in terms of what this research will mean and what
information I would like to be able to derrive from the data.

## Pieces of the project
The project is divided up into a couple of pieces:

### Generator
The Generator represents the code that will be used to build the dependency
graph as well as the code that will computer over the graph to attain various
result sets.

### Web
The web-app (Sinatra) which acts as the homepage for the project. It will be
where the results are displayed (visualized) and disected. As the project
evolves, this will become more of an app than a web-page and will be used more
heavily for interacting with the data.
